  <p>
    I am a cybersecurity executive and federal technology leader specializing in secure cloud platforms,
    compliance strategy, and mission-driven innovation. With over 15 years in IT and more than 8 years
    leading federal information security programs, I operate at the intersection of executive leadership,
    regulatory compliance, and product delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently serving as a director supporting federal PaaS and SaaS platforms, I oversee multidisciplinary
    teams across cybersecurity, platform engineering, site hosting, customer success, and business operations.
    My focus is simple: build secure systems that enable innovation without compromising trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have led major compliance and authorization initiatives, including the design and implementation of
    streamlined authorization processes for low-impact federal systems. My work has strengthened security posture,
    improved assessment efficiency, and enhanced customer confidence across government programs. I specialize in
    translating complex regulatory frameworks into practical, scalable operational models that work in real-world
    environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond federal leadership, I am also an entrepreneur committed to advancing secure technology solutions for both
    public and private sectors. Through strategic consulting and emerging ventures, I focus on helping organizations
    modernize securely, manage risk intelligently, and build resilient digital infrastructures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Originally from Togo, West Africa, and now based in North Carolina, I bring a global perspective, disciplined
    execution, and mission-first leadership to every initiative I lead. Whether in government platforms or
    entrepreneurial ventures, my goal remains the same: build systems that are secure, scalable, and built to last.
