  <h1>Hello, My name is Kudeha.</h1>
  <h1></h1>Look forward to constant updates here regarding my project.</h1>
  
  <h1>Executive Leader | Federal Security Expert | Entrepreneur </h1>
  <p>I am a cybersecurity executive and federal technology leader specializing in secure cloud platforms, compliance strategy, and mission-driven innovation. With over 15 years in IT and more than 8 years leading federal information security programs, I operate at the intersection of executive leadership, regulatory compliance, and product delivery. </p>
  <p>Currently serving as a director supporting federal PaaS and SaaS platforms, I oversee multidisciplinary teams across cybersecurity, platform engineering, site hosting, customer success, and business operations. My focus is simple: build secure systems that enable innovation without compromising trust. </p>
  <p> I have led major compliance and authorization initiatives, including the design and implementation of streamlined authorization processes for low-impact federal systems. My work has strengthened security posture, improved assessment efficiency, and enhanced customer confidence across government programs. I specialize in translating complex regulatory frameworks into practical, scalable operational models that work in real-world environments.</p>
  <p> Beyond federal leadership, I am also an entrepreneur committed to advancing secure technology solutions for both public and private sectors. Through strategic consulting and emerging ventures, I focus on helping organizations modernize securely, manage risk intelligently, and build resilient digital infrastructures.</p>
  <p> Originally from Togo, West Africa, and now based in North Carolina, I bring a global perspective, disciplined execution, and mission-first leadership to every initiative I lead. Whether in government platforms or entrepreneurial ventures, my goal remains the same: build systems that are secure, scalable, and built to last.</p>
